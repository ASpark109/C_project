# C_project
Hi, in this repository I create mini-projects in the C programming language.
The projects will mostly deal with working with: 
1) Data structures; 
2) Dynamic memory allocation;
3) Network protocols;
4) Algorithms;
5) Cryptography;
6) Programming on the Arduino platform.
hello
I'm relatively new to programming, so I understand that for more experienced dudes my code will be mostly disgusting, so please leave a comment, I'll be happy for any feedback :)

Hardware platform information: gcc (Ubuntu 9.3.0-17ubuntu1~20.04) 9.3.0
